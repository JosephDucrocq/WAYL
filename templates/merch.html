  <h1>Merchandise:</h1>

  <p>
   You can see below the different merchandise we are proposing. All of the below options are removeable ! We are making it all velcro. 
   We wanted to give people the option to be social... Or not ! Difficult day at work ? Heavy weekend back in the office on rainy Monday ?
   You might not want to put your shades and earphones on and not talk to anyone.
