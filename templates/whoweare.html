  <h1>Who we are:</h1>

  <p>

    <img src="static/Joseph.jpeg" alt="Joseph" />     
   Joseph came up with the idea some time ago. Constricted to a concept in his head due to lack of tech knowledge, after going through a coding bootcamp, he can finally create it.
   Fan of music in general, he loves small venues, radios (NTS while working !) or any kind of occasion to listne to something. Cooking in the sun with a bootle of wine and speakers is one of his guilty pleasure. 
   He believes in the communities build around passion for music. You'll probably see him walking around the London' streets with his headphones on.
